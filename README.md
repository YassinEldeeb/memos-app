# Cloud Storage For Your Best Moments

Memos is a mobile application that is built with React Native and NestJS and is available for Android on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yassineldeeb.memosapp)

Users Files are very secure and can't be lost, They are hosted on an AWS S3 Bucket.
Memos is like any other cloud storage, but It provides a very special UI that makes storing and syncing your Images/Videos more enjoyable and very user friendly.
